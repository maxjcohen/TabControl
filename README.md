# Tab Control

This Thunderbird extension aims at reducing the number of coexisting tabs during a session.

We keep track of currently opened mail tabs, in order to keep their number below a set value, `3` by default.
This value can be changed in the addon's settings.
When opening new mail tabs, additional tabs are closed, starting with the oldest.
